Shared state models and Angular services for the Primo module-federation architecture. Remote/client modules use this package to read the host application's NgRx store (user, search, filter slices) and dispatch a curated set of safe actions back to it.

## What's inside

| Layer | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Models** (`src/models/`) | TypeScript interfaces mirroring the host's state shapes: `SearchParams`, `Doc`, `UserState`, `FilterState`, `LoadingStatus`, … |
| **Services** (`src/state/`) | Three `providedIn: 'root'` Angular services — `UserStateService`, `SearchStateService`, `FilterStateService` — each offering Observable streams, one-shot Promise snapshots, Angular Signals, and typed dispatch helpers |
| **Actions** (`src/actions/`) | `shared-actions.ts` — re-exported NgRx action creators whose `type` strings match the host's reducers **byte-for-byte** |
| **Utility** (`src/utils/`) | `StateHelper` — thin wrapper around `Store` used internally by all services |

## Building & packaging

```bash
# 1. Install dev dependencies
npm install

# 2. Compile (output → dist/)
npm run build

# 3. Create a distributable tarball
npm pack
# → libis-primo-shared-state-1.0.0.tgz
```

---

## Deploying to a module-federation remote client

### Step 1 — copy the tarball into the remote project

```bash
npm pack
cp libis-primo-shared-state-1.0.0.tgz path/to/NDE_customModule/nde/
```

### Step 2 — add the `file:` dependency to the remote's `package.json`

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@libis/primo-shared-state": "file:nde/libis-primo-shared-state-1.0.0.tgz"
}
```

### Step 3 — install in the remote project

```bash
cd path/to/NDE_customModule_LIBISstyle
npm install
```

### Step 4 — declare the package as **shared** in `webpack.config.js`

This lib wraps `@ngrx/store` and `@angular/core` — both of which the host already bootstrapped as singletons. If you do **not** add it to the shared map, webpack module federation will bundle a private copy of the lib inside the remote's chunk. That private copy resolves its own `Store` injection token, which is completely isolated from the host's `Store`. As a result, all selectors return empty/`undefined` and dispatched actions are silently swallowed — the lib appears to load fine but does nothing.

The project uses `ModuleFederationPlugin` directly (not `withModuleFederationPlugin`) with the lower-level `share()` helper. Add `@libis/primo-shared-state` alongside the other shared packages:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js (remote / client only — the host has no knowledge of this lib)
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');
const mf = require('@angular-architects/module-federation/webpack');
const share = mf.share;

new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  library: { type: 'module' },
  name: 'customModule',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './custom-module': './src/bootstrap.ts',
  },
  shared: share({
    '@angular/core':             { singleton: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
    '@angular/common':           { singleton: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
    '@angular/router':           { singleton: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
    '@angular/common/http':      { requiredVersion: 'auto' },           // ¹
    '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto' },           // ¹
    'rxjs':                      { requiredVersion: 'auto' },           // ¹
    '@ngx-translate/core':       { singleton: true },
    '@ngrx/store':               { singleton: true },
    '@libis/primo-shared-state': { singleton: true, strictVersion: false },
  }),
}),
```

> **Why `singleton: true` on `@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, and `@angular/router`?**
> These three packages form Angular's core DI infrastructure — injectors, the component registry,
> and the router outlet tree. A second copy of any of them creates a completely separate DI tree
> that cannot share services, pipes, or directives with the host. `singleton: true` forces
> module federation to use whichever copy was loaded first (the host's) rather than loading a
> second one from the remote bundle.

> **¹ Why `singleton: true` is intentionally omitted on `rxjs`, `@angular/common/http`, and `@angular/platform-browser`?**
>
> Primo (the host) runs on **Angular 19.1.3** and **NgRx 19.0.0**. At the time of writing, this
> remote project is built against **Angular 18**. When `singleton: true` is set on a package
> that the host also exposes in its shared scope (which these three are), module federation
> performs a version negotiation: it picks one copy for the entire page and warns or throws if
> the versions are incompatible.
>
> Because the remote's version (`^18`) does not satisfy the host's offered version (`19.1.3`),
> adding `singleton: true` causes the following runtime crash as soon as the remote chunk loads:
>
> ```
> TypeError: t is not a function
>     at __definition.ts:653:40
>     at Array.forEach
> ```
>
> This happens because Angular 19 internals call into functions that changed signature between
> v18 and v19 — when two mismatched Angular copies are negotiated into one, the mismatch
> manifests as a broken function reference inside Angular's own code.
>
> **Without `singleton: true`**, module federation does not try to negotiate a shared instance.
> Instead it lets the remote load its own bundled copy for those packages. This means two copies
> of `rxjs` etc. exist on the page, but those packages are stateless utility libraries —
> unlike `@angular/core`, a second copy of `rxjs` causes no runtime errors.
>
> **The permanent fix** is to upgrade the remote to **Angular 19.1.x** to match Primo exactly,
> then restore `singleton: true` and `requiredVersion: 'auto'` on all Angular packages.
> Until that upgrade is done, omitting `singleton: true` on the version-mismatched packages
> is the pragmatic workaround.

> **Why `strictVersion: false` for `@libis/primo-shared-state`?**
> The host does not ship or share this lib at all — it has no knowledge of it.
> `strictVersion: true` (the default) would cause a runtime error because there is no
> host-provided version to satisfy the constraint. `strictVersion: false` tells module
> federation to use the remote's own copy without requiring a matching offer from the host.

No changes to the host's `webpack.config.js` are needed or possible — the host is a black box.

## Usage

### Observable API (reactive)

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import {
  UserStateService,
  SearchStateService,
  FilterStateService,
} from '@libis/primo-shared-state';

@Component({ /* … */ })
export class MyComponent {
  // User
  isLoggedIn$  = this.user.selectIsLoggedIn$();
  userName$    = this.user.selectUserName$();
  userGroup$   = this.user.selectUserGroup$();
  jwt$         = this.user.selectJwt$();
  settings$    = this.user.selectUserSettings$();

  // Search
  docs$         = this.search.selectAllDocs$();
  isLoading$    = this.search.selectIsLoading$();
  totalResults$ = this.search.selectTotalResults$();
  searchParams$ = this.search.selectSearchParams$();
  metaData$     = this.search.selectSearchMetaData$();
  pageSize$     = this.search.selectPageSize$();

  // Filters
  includedFilters$     = this.filter.selectIncludedFilters$();
  excludedFilters$     = this.filter.selectExcludedFilters$();
  multiFilters$        = this.filter.selectMultiSelectedFilters$();
  resourceTypeFilter$  = this.filter.selectResourceTypeFilter$();
  isFiltersOpen$       = this.filter.selectIsFiltersOpen$();

  constructor(
    private user: UserStateService,
    private search: SearchStateService,
    private filter: FilterStateService,
  ) {}
}
```

### Signal API (Angular 17+)

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { UserStateService, SearchStateService, FilterStateService } from '@libis/primo-shared-state';

@Component({
  template: `
    <p>{{ isLoggedIn() ? 'Logged in as ' + userName() : 'Guest' }}</p>
    <p>{{ totalResults() }} results — status: {{ searchStatus() }}</p>
  `
})
export class MySignalComponent {
  // User signals
  isLoggedIn  = this.user.isLoggedInSignal();
  userName    = this.user.userNameSignal();
  userGroup   = this.user.userGroupSignal();
  jwt         = this.user.jwtSignal();
  userSettings = this.user.userSettingsSignal();
  decodedJwt  = this.user.decodedJwtSignal();

  // Search signals
  docs          = this.search.allDocsSignal();
  searchParams  = this.search.searchParamsSignal();
  metaData      = this.search.searchMetaDataSignal();
  searchStatus  = this.search.searchStatusSignal();
  totalResults  = this.search.totalResultsSignal();
  pageSize      = this.search.pageSizeSignal();
  isLoading     = this.search.isLoadingSignal();

  // Filter signals
  filterState         = this.filter.filterStateSignal();
  includedFilters     = this.filter.includedFiltersSignal();
  excludedFilters     = this.filter.excludedFiltersSignal();
  multiFilters        = this.filter.multiSelectedFiltersSignal();
  resourceTypeFilter  = this.filter.resourceTypeFilterSignal();
  isFiltersOpen       = this.filter.isFiltersOpenSignal();
  isRememberAll       = this.filter.isRememberAllSignal();

  constructor(
    private user: UserStateService,
    private search: SearchStateService,
    private filter: FilterStateService,
  ) {}
}
```

### One-shot Promise snapshots (logic, not templates)

```typescript
const jwt      = await this.user.getJwt();
const loggedIn = await this.user.isLoggedIn();
const settings = await this.user.getUserSettings();

const docs     = await this.search.getAllDocs();
const doc      = await this.search.getDocById('someId');
const params   = await this.search.getSearchParams();

const included = await this.filter.getIncludedFilters();
const excluded = await this.filter.getExcludedFilters();
const multi    = await this.filter.getMultiSelectedFilters();
```

### Typed dispatch helpers

Instead of importing action creators directly, use the convenience methods on each service:

```typescript
// SearchStateService
this.search.search({ q: 'angular', scope: 'Everything' });
this.search.search({ q: 'angular', scope: 'Everything' }, 'blended');
this.search.clearSearch();
this.search.setPageLimit(25);
this.search.setPageNumber(2);
this.search.setSortBy('date');
this.search.setIsSavedSearch(true);
this.search.setSearchNotificationMessage('Saved search loaded');

// FilterStateService
this.filter.loadFilters({ q: 'angular', scope: 'Everything' });
this.filter.updateSortByParam('rank');

// UserStateService — safe settings-only operations
this.user.setLanguage('en');
this.user.setSaveHistory('true');
this.user.setUseHistory('true');
this.user.setAutoExtendMySession('false');
this.user.setAllowSavingRaSearchHistory('true');
this.user.setDecodedJwt(decodedJwtObject);
this.user.setLoginFromState('/search');
this.user.resetLogoutReason();
```

### Low-level dispatch (escape hatch)

All three services expose a `dispatch(action)` method for anything not covered by the helpers:

```typescript
import { resetJwtAction } from '@libis/primo-shared-state';

this.user.dispatch(resetJwtAction({ logoutReason: 'user' }));
```

You can also import action creators directly:

```typescript
import {
  searchAction,
  clearSearchAction,
  pageLimitChangedAction,
  loadFiltersAction,
  setDecodedJwt,
  // …
} from '@libis/primo-shared-state';
```

> ⚠️ **Effects warning** — the host app has NgRx Effects listening to these actions (HTTP calls, etc.). Do **not** register your own `EffectsModule.forFeature()` with effects that re-implement the same actions. Use `Actions` + `ofType` to *listen* without triggering duplicates.

---

## Why not all host actions are exported

### The safety gate

`shared-actions.ts` acts as a **compile-time safety gate**. Because it is the only place action creators are exported from the package, TypeScript prevents any remote module from importing — and therefore dispatching — an action that has not been explicitly approved. A named import that does not exist in `shared-actions.ts` will fail at compile time, before your code ever runs:

```typescript
// ✅ Works — searchSuccessAction is exported
import { searchSuccessAction } from '@libis/primo-shared-state';

// ❌ Compile error — deliverySuccessAction is not exported
import { deliverySuccessAction } from '@libis/primo-shared-state';
```

This gate only protects you if you use named imports. The two anti-patterns below both bypass it silently — which is exactly what makes them dangerous.

> **The golden rule: if it is not exported from `shared-actions.ts`, do not dispatch it.**

### ⛔ Anti-pattern: dispatching non-exported actions via their literal type string

The most dangerous mistake is reaching past the safety gate by constructing an action manually using its raw type string:

```typescript
// ❌ DO NOT DO THIS
this.store.dispatch({ type: '[Collection Discovery] Get Collections Tree Success', tree: subset });
```

This bypasses every guarantee the export list provides. Even if it appears to work today, you have no protection against:

- **State corruption** — the action's reducer may overwrite data that other host components depend on.
- **Unintended HTTP side-effects** — a host effect may be listening to that action type and fire a real HTTP call in response.
- **Silent breakage on upgrades** — the host can rename, split, or remove that action at any time without notice; your remote will break with no compile-time error.

The same risk applies to dispatching `*Success` or `*Failed` actions that are not exported, even if their names look harmless. An action being named "success" does not make it safe to dispatch from a remote.

### ⛔ Anti-pattern: patching PNX data via a local overlay

A tempting workaround when the server returns wrong or missing `pnx` data is to build a client-side overlay service that intercepts the store's docs, applies local patches, and exposes a "corrected" Observable or Signal:

```typescript
// ❌ DO NOT DO THIS
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class DocPatchService {
  private patches$ = new BehaviorSubject<Map<string, Partial<Pnx>>>(new Map());

  patchDocPnx(recordId: string, patch: Partial<Pnx>): void {
    // …merge patch into map…
  }

  selectAllDocsPatched$(): Observable<Doc[]> {
    return combineLatest([storeDocs$, this.patches$]).pipe(
      map(([docs, patches]) => docs.map(doc => applyPatch(doc, patches.get(doc['@id']))))
    );
  }
}
```

**Why you shouldn't do this:**

1. **Split truth** — host components always read the original, unpatched entities from the NgRx store. Your remote component would show corrected data while every host component (search result tiles, full display, availability panel) still shows the wrong data side-by-side. The user sees inconsistent information on the same screen.

2. **Fragile lifecycle** — you must manually track when to clear the patch (new search, navigation, full-display open). Any timing gap means stale overrides bleed across searches.

3. **Invisible to devtools** — because the patches live outside the store, NgRx DevTools shows the original state. Debugging why a component renders something different from what the store contains becomes very confusing.

4. **Symptom, not cause** — if the server consistently returns wrong data, the fix belongs server-side (Primo NUI configuration, normalization rules, or a back-end mapping). A client overlay papers over a data quality issue without fixing it.

**The correct approach** when `pnx` data needs correction:

- Fix the data at source — adjust the Primo NUI/backend configuration so the server returns correct data.
- If you only need to *display* derived or supplemental data (e.g. a cover image from a third-party API), keep that data entirely in your remote component's local state and never mix it with store docs.
- If you need to react to what the server returned, use `selectAllDocs$()` to read the data and apply display-layer transformations in your component's template pipe or view model — without touching or shadowing the store.

### What is exported and why

`shared-actions.ts` exports three kinds of actions:

#### ✅ Commands — trigger a host operation

These tell the host to start a well-defined operation. The host's effects own the HTTP call; the remote only supplies the parameters.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `searchAction` | Tells the host to run a search |
| `loadFiltersAction` | Triggers a filter HTTP call via the host's effect |
| `clearSearchAction` | Resets search state, no HTTP call |

#### ✅ Pure UI-state writes — no downstream effects

These write a simple scalar to the store. No host effect listens to them, so there is no risk of triggering an HTTP call.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pageLimitChangedAction` | Updates the page size in the store |
| `pageNumberChangedAction` | Updates the current page |
| `sortByChangedAction` | Updates the sort field |
| `doneChangeUserSettingsLanguageAction` | Writes the chosen language to the user slice |

#### ✅ Exported success/failed actions — terminal writes with no downstream effects

Some `*Success` and `*Failed` actions **are** exported. These are safe because they are **terminal writes** — their reducer updates the store, and no host effect listens to them afterwards. Dispatching them is equivalent to telling the host "treat this data as if the server returned it".

| Action | Why safe to dispatch |
|---|---|
| `searchSuccessAction` | Writes search results to the store; no effect fires on it |
| `searchFailedAction` | Sets an error/loading flag; no effect fires on it |
| `filtersSuccessAction` | Writes filter data to the store; no effect fires on it |
| `filterFailedAction` | Sets a filter error flag; no effect fires on it |

> **Not all success actions are safe.** The export list is the definitive answer. For example, `deliverySuccessAction` is **not** exported because a host effect listens to it and fires a second HTTP call. See the chain below.

#### ❌ Excluded — effect outputs that feed downstream effects

These are actions the host's effects emit after an HTTP call, and another effect listens to them in turn. Dispatching them from a remote corrupts state and fires real HTTP calls.

A concrete example is `deliverySuccessAction`:

```
searchSuccessAction              ← ✅ exported, remote CAN dispatch
    └─► [Search] Load delivery   ← DeliveryEffect fires an HTTP call
            └─► deliverySuccessAction   ← ❌ NOT exported; effect emits this when HTTP responds
                    │
                    ├─► search.reducer  overwrites pnx data on every Doc entity
                    └─► DeliveryEffect  triggers a second HTTP call (eDelivery)
```

If a remote dispatched `deliverySuccessAction` with a fabricated or incomplete `Doc[]` payload it would **overwrite `pnx` data** on all current search result entities (blanking display fields, availability, links) and simultaneously fire a real HTTP call to the delivery service.

#### ❌ Excluded — auth flow triggers

Actions such as `[User] load jwt guest`, `[User] load logged user jwt`, and `[User] reset jwt` kick off OAuth/ILS authentication flows managed entirely by the host. A remote module has no business initiating or short-circuiting those flows.

### Decision table

| Category | Exported | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Commands — start a search / filter load | ✅ | Remote legitimately triggers these |
| Pure UI-state writes — pagination, sort, clear | ✅ | No HTTP side-effects |
| Safe settings writes — language, history toggles | ✅ | Only mutate the user settings slice |
| Terminal success/failed writes — no downstream effects | ✅ | Safe to dispatch; no effect listens to them |
| Success/failed actions that feed downstream effects | ❌ | Re-triggers HTTP calls and corrupts state |
| Auth flow triggers — JWT load, login, logout | ❌ | Authentication is owned entirely by the host |
| Any action not in `shared-actions.ts` | ❌ | Even via literal type string — bypasses all safety guarantees |

### Listening to non-exported actions without dispatching them

If you need to *react* to an action that is not exported (e.g. do something after delivery finishes loading), use `Actions` + `ofType` to listen passively — **do not dispatch**:

```typescript
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { Actions, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';

// Inside a service or component constructor:
private actions$ = inject(Actions);

constructor() {
  // React to delivery completing without dispatching anything
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType('[Search] Load delivery success')   // use the literal type string
  ).subscribe(({ docsToUpdate }) => {
    // read-only reaction — never re-dispatch this action
  });
}
```

> Do **not** register an `EffectsModule.forFeature()` in the remote with effects that handle the same action type strings as the host — that causes every HTTP call to fire twice.

## Troubleshooting

### `NullInjectorError: No provider for Store`
The remote module is loading before the host has bootstrapped. Ensure lazy-loaded remote modules are only instantiated after the host's `StoreModule.forRoot()` runs.

### `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user')`
The host store state slice is not yet populated. Use `selectIsLoggedIn$()` as a guard or wait for `status !== 'pending'` before reading.

### Version mismatch errors at runtime
`@angular/core`, `@ngrx/store`, and `rxjs` **must** resolve to a single shared instance. Confirm they are listed as singletons in both the host's and remote's webpack sharing config.

### Signal methods throw `NG0203` (must be called in injection context)
`toSignal` requires an injection context. Signal methods called inside a constructor (or `providedIn: 'root'` service constructor) are fine. If you call them inside a method body, wrap with `runInInjectionContext`.

---

## Versioning

Bump `version` in `package.json` before every `npm pack`:

```bash
npm version patch   # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1  (bug fixes)
npm version minor   # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0  (new methods, backward-compatible)
npm version major   # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0  (breaking changes)
npm run build
npm pack
```

## Regenerating this package

This package is generated from decompiled Primo host application source code. Use [primo-extract](https://www.npmjs.com/package/primo-extract) to extract the source from a running Primo instance, then use either the Claude Code slash command (recommended) or the manual prompt below.

### Step 1 — extract the host source

```bash
primoExtract --primo=https://your.primo.instance --outDir=/path/to/extracted/source --nde
```

### Step 2 — regenerate the package

#### Using the Claude Code slash command

If you are working in this repository with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), a `/regenerate` slash command is available. Open Claude Code at the root of this repository and run:

```
/regenerate /path/to/extracted/source
```

Claude will automatically detect whether the package needs to be created from scratch or updated, apply the safety rules for `shared-actions.ts`, bump the version, and append an entry to `CHANGES.md`. The full command definition lives in `.claude/commands/regenerate.md`.

#### Using the LLM prompt manually

If you are not using Claude Code, copy the prompt below into Claude (or any capable LLM) together with the contents of the extracted source directory.

---

### The prompt

````
You are an expert Angular and NgRx engineer. You will be given decompiled source code from a Primo host application, extracted using primo-extract. Your task is to generate or update the `@libis/primo-shared-state` npm package.

---

## Context

The package exposes three things to remote/client module-federation modules:
1. **TypeScript models** — interfaces that mirror the host's NgRx state shapes.
2. **Angular services** — `UserStateService`, `SearchStateService`, `FilterStateService`, each offering Observable streams, Promise snapshots, Angular Signals, and typed dispatch helpers.
3. **Shared actions** — `shared-actions.ts`, a curated list of NgRx action creators whose `type` strings match the host's reducers byte-for-byte, exported only if they are safe for a remote to dispatch (see safety rules below).

---

## Safety rules for shared-actions.ts

An action is safe to export **only if** dispatching it from a remote module cannot corrupt store state or trigger unintended HTTP side-effects. Apply this checklist to every action:

- ✅ **Export** — commands that start a well-defined host operation (search, filter load) where the remote legitimately supplies the parameters.
- ✅ **Export** — pure UI-state writes (pagination, sort, clear) with no HTTP side-effects.
- ✅ **Export** — terminal success/failed actions whose reducer writes to the store and **no host effect listens to them downstream**.
- ❌ **Do not export** — success/failed actions that feed a downstream effect (i.e. another effect listens to them and fires an HTTP call).
- ❌ **Do not export** — actions that initiate OAuth/ILS authentication flows.
- ❌ **Do not export** — actions that carry server-authoritative payloads (e.g. full entity lists with pnx data) that a remote cannot construct legitimately.

When in doubt, **exclude**. It is safer to omit an action than to export one that can cause silent data corruption.

## Your instructions

### If the `src/` directory is empty or does not exist — generate the full package

1. Analyse the decompiled source and identify all NgRx state slices, reducers, effects, and action creators.
2. Generate the full package structure:
   - `src/models/` — TypeScript interfaces for every relevant state shape.
   - `src/actions/shared-actions.ts` — apply the safety rules above. Add a JSDoc comment to every exported action explaining why it is safe. Add a comment block at the top of the file with an EFFECTS WARNING (remotes must not register their own effects for the same action types).
   - `src/state/` — one service per state slice with Observable, Promise, Signal, and dispatch APIs.
   - `src/utils/StateHelper` — thin Store wrapper used internally by services.
   - `src/index.ts` — barrel export.
   - `package.json` — name `@libis/primo-shared-state`, version `1.0.0`.
   - `CHANGES.md` — create with a `## 1.0.0` section listing everything generated.
3. Add the following notice to the top of `README.md`:
   > 🤖 Generated by Claude (Anthropic) from decompiled Primo source via primo-extract. Do not edit by hand.

### If `src/` already contains code — update the existing package

1. Compare the decompiled source against the existing package code. Identify:
   - **New** actions, state slices, or model fields → add them.
   - **Changed** action type strings, payload shapes, or reducer behaviour → update them and note the change.
   - **Removed** actions or state slices → **do not silently delete**. Instead:
     - Flag each removal explicitly with a `⚠️ BREAKING REMOVAL` warning in your response.
     - List every exported symbol that would be deleted and what consuming code would break.
     - Ask for confirmation before removing anything that is currently exported.
2. Apply all safe additions and updates.
3. Bump the version in `package.json`:
   - `patch` — if only non-breaking additions or internal changes.
   - `minor` — if new exported symbols are added.
   - `major` — if any exported symbol is removed or its signature changes in a breaking way.
4. Append a new version section to `CHANGES.md` in this format:

```markdown
## <new version> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

### Added
- …

### Changed
- …

### ⚠️ Breaking removals (confirm before applying)
- …
```

## Output format

- Produce complete, ready-to-use file contents for every file you create or modify.
- For updates, show only the changed files in full — do not truncate.
- Prefix every file with a fenced code block header: `// FILE: path/to/file`.
- After all files, print a short summary table:

| File | Action | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| src/actions/shared-actions.ts | updated | new `fooAction` added; `barSuccessAction` excluded (feeds downstream effect) |
| … | … | … |
